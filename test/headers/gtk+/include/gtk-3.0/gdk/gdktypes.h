/**
 * GdkModifierType:

 * @GDK_LOCK_MASK: a Lock key (depending on the modifier mapping of the
 *  X server this may either be CapsLock or ShiftLock).
 * @GDK_CONTROL_MASK: the Control key.
 * @GDK_MOD1_MASK: the fourth modifier key (it depends on the modifier
 *  mapping of the X server which key is interpreted as this modifier, but
 *  normally it is the Alt key).
 * @GDK_MOD2_MASK: the fifth modifier key (it depends on the modifier
 *  mapping of the X server which key is interpreted as this modifier).
 * @GDK_MOD3_MASK: the sixth modifier key (it depends on the modifier
 *  mapping of the X server which key is interpreted as this modifier).
 * @GDK_MOD4_MASK: the seventh modifier key (it depends on the modifier
 *  mapping of the X server which key is interpreted as this modifier).
 * @GDK_MOD5_MASK: the eighth modifier key (it depends on the modifier
 *  mapping of the X server which key is interpreted as this modifier).
 * @GDK_BUTTON1_MASK: the first mouse button.
 * @GDK_BUTTON2_MASK: the second mouse button.
 * @GDK_BUTTON3_MASK: the third mouse button.
 * @GDK_BUTTON4_MASK: the fourth mouse button.
 * @GDK_BUTTON5_MASK: the fifth mouse button.
 * @GDK_MODIFIER_RESERVED_13_MASK: A reserved bit flag; do not use in your own code
 * @GDK_SUPER_MASK: the Super modifier. Since 2.10
 * @GDK_HYPER_MASK: the Hyper modifier. Since 2.10
 * @GDK_META_MASK: the Meta modifier. Since 2.10
 * @GDK_RELEASE_MASK: not used in GDK itself. GTK+ uses it to differentiate
 *  between (keyval, modifiers) pairs from key press and release events.
 * @GDK_MODIFIER_MASK: a mask covering all modifier types.
 *
 * A set of bit-flags to indicate the state of modifier keys and mouse buttons
 * in various event types. Typical modifier keys are Shift, Control, Meta,
 * Super, Hyper, Alt, Compose, Apple, CapsLock or ShiftLock.
 *
 * Like the X Window System, GDK supports 8 modifier keys and 5 mouse buttons.
 *
 * Since 2.10, GDK recognizes which of the Meta, Super or Hyper keys are mapped
 * to Mod2 - Mod5, and indicates this by setting %GDK_SUPER_MASK,
 * %GDK_HYPER_MASK or %GDK_META_MASK in the state field of key events.
 *
 * Note that GDK may add internal values to events which include
 * reserved values such as %GDK_MODIFIER_RESERVED_13_MASK.  Your code
 * should preserve and ignore them.  You can use %GDK_MODIFIER_MASK to
 * remove all reserved values.

 * number of %GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY events received. Normally a %GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY

 * spends a lot of time processing the event (updating the display, for example),
 * it can lag behind the position of the mouse. When using
 * %GDK_POINTER_MOTION_HINT_MASK, fewer %GDK_MOTION_NOTIFY events will be sent,

 * To receive more motion events after a motion hint event, the application
 * needs to asks for more, by calling gdk_event_request_motions().
 *
 * If %GDK_TOUCH_MASK is enabled, the window will receive touch events
 * from touch-enabled devices. Those will come as sequences of #GdkEventTouch
 * with type %GDK_TOUCH_UPDATE, enclosed by two events with
 * type %GDK_TOUCH_BEGIN and %GDK_TOUCH_END (or %GDK_TOUCH_CANCEL).
 * gdk_event_get_event_sequence() returns the event sequence for these
 * events, so different sequences may be distinguished.
